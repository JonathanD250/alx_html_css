# Advanced CSS Project

This project is a continuation of the **HTML, advanced** project. The focus here is on applying CSS styling to a webpage structure provided earlier. The goal is to match the design given in the Figma file as closely as possible.

## Objectives

- Build a complete webpage based on a designer file (Figma).
- Apply modern CSS techniques to style the HTML structure.
- Use semantic HTML combined with clean and maintainable CSS.
- Reproduce the layout, typography, and spacing from the Figma design.

## Resources

- Figma design file: [Link to Figma] (#)  
- Fonts: [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) and Spin Cycle OT.  
- Images: Provided in the project resources.  

## Files

- `index.html`: Contains the full HTML structure of the webpage.
- `style.css`: Contains all CSS styling rules for the project.
- `README.md`: Project overview and documentation.

## Notes

- Some values in Figma are floats; rounded values were used where appropriate.
- Custom fonts are linked through Google Fonts or locally if downloaded.
- All images are placed in the appropriate tags inside the HTML.
